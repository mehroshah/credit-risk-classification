credit-risk-classification:
Machine learning techniques are used to analyze a dataset of historical lending that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

ANALYSIS:
Factors considered;
1.loan size
2.interest rate
3.borrowers income
4.debt to income ratio
5.No of accounts borrower had
6.degoratory marks against borrower
7.Total debt

The dataset (77,536 data points) was split into training and testing sets. The training set was used to build an initial logistic regression model (Logistic Regression Model 1) using the LogisticRegression module from scikit-learn. Logistic Regression Model 1 was then applied to the testing dataset. The purpose of the model was to determine whether a loan to the borrower in the testing set would be low- or high-risk and results are summarized below.


RESULTS:

ogistic Regression Model 1:

1.Precision: 93% (an average--in predicting low-risk loans, the model was 100% precise, though the model was only 87% precise in predicting high-risk loans)
Accuracy: 94%
Recall: 95% (an average--the model had 100% recall in predicting low-risk loans, but 89% recall in predicting high-risk loans)
Logistic Regression Model 2:

2.Precision: 93% (an average--in predicting low-risk loans, the model was 100% precise, though the model was only 87% precise in predicting high-risk loans)
Accuracy: 100%
Recall: 100%


SUMMARY:

Logistic Regression Model 2 is less likely to predict false negative results. However, based on the confusion matrices for each model, Logistic Regression Model 2 predicted slightly more false positives (low-risk when the actual was high-risk).

If the goal of the model is to determine the likelihood of high-risk loans, neither model scores above 90% precision. Logistic Regression Model 2 had fewer false predictions of the testing data overall and would be the best model to use based on the high accuracy and recall of this model.
